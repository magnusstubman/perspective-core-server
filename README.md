# perspective
A simple task manager for agile software development.

!!! Alpha quality for now - work in progress !!!

By providing information tailored to the needs of each individual at any given time, our vision is that Perspective
is ***the*** single tool you or your team needs to work in the most productive way possible.

## How (aka Goals)?
* Provide each member of a team with the information most relevant to them
* Free and open-source so that anyone can use it and contribute
* Accessible, as in:
	* installable behind a company's firewall or on your own machine
	* designed for use with a regular computer, phone, TV or projector
* Flexible:
	* Have a need that is not covered by Perspective? Need to integrate with existing tools?
		* Look for a existing plugin that extends Perspective with the features you want
		* Write your own plugin and conquer the world :)
	* Can be tailored to fit most processes
* Simple:
	* A user interface that is easy to use
	* No complex workflows or permission schemes
	* Sensible defaults that helps the end user or team
